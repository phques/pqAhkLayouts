* with LAlt used for layer access, ctrl+alt+Left/Right does not work in BBZero
  -> that's bacause Alt is not sent, similar to using Alt-gr

* cannot define AHK hotkeys anymore !!
  -> can choose a key that will not have a hotkey created for the layout,
     and then create hotkeys normally for it (eg. LWin)
  -> also could define a layer used to create 'Action' keys
     - get the keydef from the layer and re-assign the key.onHoldDn ..
       (should support this in the code! 'action keys')
      ** a keydef could hold actions vs outVals,
        so the funcs called foo onHold etc would be tied to out vs keydef
        (need ts see if this is worth it, not certain I see an advantage)

* layer lock key action (eg. for numpad) 
 (again, should support in code to avoid probs)

* fix missing help image code that avoids flashing layer change on dualMode space
* move hotkeys to separate file
* create image for numpad
