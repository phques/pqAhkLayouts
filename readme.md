AutoHotkey scripts to help do keyboard layouts / mappings.  
From a straightforward Colemak layout to a more complex layout with letters on Capslock etc.  

At this moment there is nothing functional yet !  
Planned :  
 - layers: main layer, shifted, alt, altShifted, extend etc 
 - dual mode modifiers: Shift acts as shift when held down with other keys, but generates  somethng else on press / release 
 - 
Written for AutoHotkey_2.0-a089 or newer

 I am using code from the Pkl project to display an on screen help image of the kbd layout,
