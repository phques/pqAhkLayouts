If I could have 4 layers (main, mainShift, altGr, altGrSh) in the optimizer,
how would I design a layout ?


21 sym keys,     42 syms (includes 0-9)
26 letters keys  52 chars
=
47 keys          94 syms/chars

with 4 layers, need 24keys = 96syms 
(actualyy that matches exactly if we add space and return)

--
but using numpad, remove 0-9
so 84 syms/chars
with 4 layers, need exactly 21keys

((
 oops forgot Space / enter! some layouts include them on main keys
 84+2 86 ... 86/4 = 21.5
 so would be missing 2 syms w. 21keys
 go to 22keys.. 88 syms (also even left/right: 11 + 11)
))

min beakl keys = 9+2 * 2 = 22
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
 zxc   m,.

----

min lasalle keys = 18 (9x2)
(here I really want to keep only the good keys)
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
   c   m

need 21, has 18 so need 3 more
add 4 (2x2) keys, 1 extra !
  3     9
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
   cv nm

or try exactly 21 (dont use v)
  3     9
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
   c  nm

not too crazy about using keys on 1-0 ..
(potentialy use 'em for Fn keys !)

18 + 2 : 20 ... 80 syms
miss 6
