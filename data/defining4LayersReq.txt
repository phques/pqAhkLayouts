If I could have 4 layers (main, mainShift, altGr, altGrSh) in the optimizer,
how would I design a layout ?


21 sym keys,     42 syms (includes 0-9)
26 letters keys  52 chars
=
47 keys          94 syms/chars

with 4 layers, need 24keys = 96syms

--
but using numpad, remove 0-9
so 84 syms/chars
with 4 layers, need exactly 21keys

oops forgot Space !

----

min beakl keys = 9+2 * 2 = 22
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
 zxc   m,.

----

min lasalle keys = 18 (9x2)
(here I really want to keep only the good keys)
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
   c   m

need 21, has 18 so need 3 more
add 4 (2x2) keys, 1 extra !
  3     9
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
   cv nm

or try exactly 21 (dont use v)
  3     9
 wer   uio
asdfg hjkl;
   c  nm
