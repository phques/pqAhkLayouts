- do need to track all keys for dual mode
  - after dual key down, must check next key

- track / handle 100% modifiers
  - so define hotkeys for l/r shift/ctrl/alt

- everything is on own layer
  - shifted layer is separate, w. Shift as access
  - extend
  
- detect chord on key down
  - layer select
  ? own hotkeys (to solve prob of hotkeys defined in AHK not working, eg ^+0
  
- dual mode modifiers
  ? applies / generalized to dual mode o other keys, like Space to access layer ?
  
- key def
  - scancode
  ? key name
  - output code scan
  - is modifier
  - is layer access key
  ? dual mode output
  
- track
  - layer
  - modifiers down
  - chord keys down
  - dual mode key d own
