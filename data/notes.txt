redo handling of modifiers
have to follow way system works
 when ctrl-shift-s is pressed, it is not ctrl-S !
 or alt-shift-u
 in this case, come out of shifted layer and send all keys

 need to figure out how to use or not use Send '{blind}' !!
 and if to send or not the modifier keys.. (well, Shift actually !)
 -=>
all layer access mods are 'dont send', except shift
need to check for unshifted chars being sent while shift is down
 
?go back to having shift be a sppecial version of a layer?
vs an independent layer

CapsLock does not shift !!

- does not curr support shift-altGr / multi key layer acces
- deadkey 
   -  #redo, check output *chars* not keys
   - ^ cancels on shift up ??
   - right now it is per KEY ! ie '6' not '^', 
     which means we can't have diff dk on main/shift/altgr
     can't have a compose char on dual mode mod!
- dual  mode locking layer chg! for extend
- locking layer chg, ie 
     numlock => numpad
     ctrl-space => lock extend layer
 - dual mode modifiers : 
    - in some layouts, we tend to do rolls w. two shift dualmods
      which of course does not do what we expect !!
    - altshft mouse! Shft-up outputs the alternate char out
    - could have repeating by doing dn/up/dn,dn,dn..
       can cause probs : rshift dn/up for V
 - chords (ctrl-x, alt-shift)
    for hotkeys
    for layer access
