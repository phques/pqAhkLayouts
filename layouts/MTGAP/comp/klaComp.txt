comparing my MTGAP LaSalle layouts in Keyboard Layout Analyzer (KLA)

my best three (Average)(ran multiple texts all in same text):

0% 78.95 mtgapLs24Sp1.0-mirr
1% 79.48 mtgapLs24v1.0

3% 81.03 mtgapLs24Sp1.0 
3% 81.38 (BEAKL PLLT x1)

Didn't do programming comp .. 
need to complete my layouts for syms etc !

Note that mtgapLs24Sp1.0 with Space on main, 
has much higher hand use for the hand with Space,
and was originally generated with this on the right hand (vowels)
(mtgapLs24Sp1.0-mirr is the original actually)
