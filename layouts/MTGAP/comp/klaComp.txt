comparing my MTGAP LaSalle layouts in Keyboard Layout Analyzer (KLA)

my best three (Average)(ran multiple texts all in same text):

0% 78.95 mtgapLs24Sp1.0-mirr
1% 79.48 mtgapLs24v1.0

3% 81.03 mtgapLs24Sp1.0 
3% 81.38 (BEAKL PLLT x1)

Didn't do programming comp .. 
need to complete my layouts for syms etc !

Note that mtgapLs24Sp1.0 with Space on main, 
has much higher hand use for the hand with Space,
and was originally generated with this on the right hand (vowels)
(mtgapLs24Sp1.0-mirr is the original actually)

Even though it is more difficult to get used to having the vowels+space
on the right, it might make sense to have this high load on the right,
since my left forearm gets uncomfortable when typing more

On the other hand, mtgapLs24v1.0,
vowels on the left, no space on main,
has almost 50-50 left/right balance
