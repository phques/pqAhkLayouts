best of my layouts mtap lasalle (that I'm taking interest into)
tests on KLA, using compound texts alice+jonathan+prince+farm+dragonboy

** std US kbd KLA versions  **
  (altGr thumb on space, some CR on main)

+ including few tests on some code (limited subset)
mtgapUsLs26SpCr4.2b / mtgapUsLs26SpCr4.1b (Cr on main)
mtgapUsLs28Sp3.3bCrSh
mtgapUsLs22Sp3.3pq1bCrSh


- This one gets better KLA if I move B from altgr top row to its usual place on bottom
 It seems to be caused by higher sameHand, which I'm guessing is caused by 
 right thumb (SP=AltGr) + B access (sameHand)
 => mtgapUsLs22Sp3.3pq1bCrShB (as in  mtgapUsLs28Sp3.3bCrSh)

- This would be better handled by KLA if it did consider SP home of two thumbs the same
 way it does for Shifts (which is what I do physically): use opposite hand for SP vs key.
 Since in reality I do place B on SP, mtgapUsLs22Sp3.3pq1bCrShB represents my layout reality!

3.3b (3.3 swap ,')
vs 3.1bRD very similar
3.3b has lower sameFinger and finger Use

NEW, noticed same finger TR in 3.1b,
  checked 2.8 and RD are swapped,
  tried that in 3.1 !! and best results yet 3.1.bRD

  ...
considering 3.1b, 2.8b, 3.0b 2.1c

--3.1b vs 2.8b,
3.1b > 'same'
after analysis is seems to be because higher (single finger & hand) thumb use.
since I use SP as thumb key for altGr and it can only be ONE thumb on KLA,
in real life this would alternate left/right and that part of the score would be better

2.8 was created w. lower weights on top digits row, 
it has <sameFinger but >dist/fingerCost

--3.1b vs 3.0,
similar, 3.1 has better placed syms ('keepBrackets=1')

considering 2.8, 2.5b 2.5b has similar values to 2.8 except higher sameHand
cant say I like 2.5b, french in particular was not very good on quick test
2.1cb ?

** MATRIX form !!**

compared to a favorite of mine

this one's advantage: "easy", syms placed logically
